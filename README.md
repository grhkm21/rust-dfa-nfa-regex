# DN-Regex

## Project Aim

I wonder what DN stands for... In this project, I aim to implement conversion between DFA, NFA and Regex representations of regular expressions in Rust.

## TODO

#### Core Functionality

[ ] Implement DFA representation
[x] Implement NFA representation
[ ] Implement Regex representation

#### Representation Conversion

[ ] Implement NFA -> DFA
[ ] Implement DFA -> Regex
[ ] Implement Regex -> DFA

#### Visualization

[x] Implement exporting NFA to `.dot`
[ ] Implement exporting NFA to `.png`
[ ] Implement exporting DFA to `.dot`
[ ] Implement exporting DFA to `.png`

[ ] Abstract `dump`-related functions to separate struct
